Read XLSX file

requirements:
identifier, customer, FULL address

# customer can have multiple addresses?
# does the XLSX file represent a chain? if so customer == chain
# Handler to seperate chains and addresses (if in the same column)


self.payload["customers"] {
	"street": "4933 Yukon Ave",
	"city": "New Hope",
	"state": "MN",
	"zip": "",
	"phone": 7632429365
}

Where I left off:
works with column_phone_sep.xlsx but probably broke full address
pass full address to addressor!
find a way to remove phone from address (if in there)
find a way to remove chain from address (if in there)
